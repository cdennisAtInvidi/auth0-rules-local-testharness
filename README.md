# What is it?

The *auth0-rules-local-testharness* library provides an easy way to deploy, execute, and test the output of Auth0 Rules using a local sandbox environment. It is very simple to use, and requires under 5 minutes to get started testing your Auth0 Rules! 

See here for further documentation on [Auth0 Rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).

This package helps the developers to test their rules in their local development environment or in a CI environment instead of testing them against the real rules engine. This package exposes just one method, `runInLocalSandbox` which can be called to run the rule in an emulator similar to that of the Auth0's rules engine. It piggy backs on nodejs `vm` package to do it.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
